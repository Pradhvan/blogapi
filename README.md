# Demo API

- Simple blog API built to play with django-filters and PostgreSQL Native Full-Text Search, built to close [1039](https://github.com/carltongibson/django-filter/issues/1039)

- Also uses Django Debug Toolbar and Silk for basic profiling of ORM queries while using Full-Text Search.

- Implements a custom CountlessPaginator to bypass the costly COUNT(*) query, which Djangoâ€™s default paginator uses to determine the number of pages. This optimization is crucial when dealing with large datasets, such as the 1,00,000+ posts in the database.
